                        <p>
                            Ok, so here you are thinking of why anyone would use Linux as it
                            is only for programmers. But hear me out for a second and let me
                            show you the interesting world of Linux. Yes, it was like that
                            when it first came out, but today the Linux environment has
                            changed very much without giving up its usability.
                        </p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="vtimeline-point">
                <div class="vtimeline-icon">
                </div>
                <div class="vtimeline-block">
                    <span class="vtimeline-title">Linux Looks and Usability</span>
                    <div class="vtimeline-content-column">
                        <div>
                            <img src="./images/linux_usability.png" alt="" class="img-fluid mb20" />
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Now, you know that in terms of looks, Linux is equal to if not
                            better than Windows. But looks are not the only thing you want
                            to check if you buy something. Ohh, but it looks like Linux is
                            free and open source. Now, what the heck is open source? It
                            means that its code is available to see and download for free.
                            Also, you can change it and distribute it for free.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="vtimeline-point">

                    <div class="vtimeline-content-column">
                        <p>
                            Next comes security. You might be thinking that if the code is
                            available for everyone to see, someone can check the
                            vulnerabilities and alter it to hack or corrupt a system. But
                            here's an amazing thing. If one person with malicious intent is
                            trying to find loopholes, hundreds, if not thousands, are trying
                            to find it so that they can be fixed. Thus, Linux is way more
                            safe than Windows in a straightforward comparison. Also, you can
                            be sure that the creators are not spying on you because if they
                            were, someone would find out in their code and tell the world.

                            Now I think I gave you enough reasons to use Linux. But there is
                            always a catch to good things. In this case, the catch is
                            installing applications. To install applications, you have to
                            use the provided package manager, which I think contains all the
                            packages a non-programmer needs. Also, they are all free to use.
                            But for beginner programmers, some Linux distributions may be
                            quite punishing. So, I have curated the below list ranking some
                            Linux distros or you can say flavors on the basis of their
                            learning curve.

                            Now I know the above list can be quite intimidating at first, so if you are a little bit
                            experienced in using Linux, you can choose whatever you want. But for beginners or a little
                            above beginners, I will recommend Ubuntu or Manjaro. I have used them myself and have faced
                            a little difficulties at first.

                            But once you get a hang of it, I assure you, you will only get back to Windows for gaming or
                            some software which is only supported by Windows.

                            Talking about gaming, I can assume that most of you would like gaming, so you would be
                            thinking Linux is not for me, but that is not true at all. There are many games that are not
                            supported on Linux right now. Focus on the word "right now." I am not saying this because I
                            want to force you to use Linux as nothing will come out of it for me. There are many games
                            which are supported by many Linux distros right now like Dota 2, CS:GO, and many more (I
                            would love to list them here but let's not derail from our track). Many Linux distros are
                            constantly being developed for a better gaming experience, and I am sure they will soon
                            surpass Windows in gaming too.

                            them but still have not found my ideal distribution yet. Although I love Manjaro, and am
                            currently using it.

                            some mistakes that you can do while installing and how to avoid them.
