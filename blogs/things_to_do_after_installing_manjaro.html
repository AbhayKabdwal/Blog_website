                        <p>
                            First things first
                            Lets first update your mirrors list and also update your complete system up to date
                            Even though you donwloaded it right now does not mean that the system will be up to date
                            So you can do this by running the following commands in the terminal
                            Dont know how to open a terminal yet?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just press `Ctrl + Shift + t`
                            Now a terminal would be in front of you
                            Copy and paste the following commands
                        </p>
                        <p class="dark">sudo pacman-mirrors -f && sudo pacman -Syyu</p>
                        <p>
                            Then enter the following command
                        </p>
                        <p class="dark">sudo pacman -Syu</p>
                        <p>This will completely update your system</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Now you need to setup Snap store which is a reliable linux application distributor
                            So to install the store using the mirrors you just updated
                        </p>
                        <p>Enter the following command</p>
                        <p class="dark">sudo pacman -S snapd</p>
                        <p>Once installed, the systemd unit that manages the main snap communication socket needs to be enabled</p>
                        <p class="dark">sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket</p>
                        <p>To enable classic snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between /var/lib/snapd/snap and /snap</p>
                        <p class="dark">sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap</p>
                        <p>After successful completion of the above step you need to restart the system to update the environment variables</p>
                        <br />
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <p>
                            Now you can easily install applications using snap store but what about backup
                            Everyone fears of losing data in case of a system crash.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For creating a backup I present to you our favourite -- Timeshift 
                            To install timeshift you need to run the following command
                        </p>
                        <p class="dark">sudo pacman -S timeshift</p>
                        <p>
                            Now go to the Timeshift wizard and setup the timeshift as you need as shown in the following images
                        </p>
                        <br />

                        <p>
                            Now even though you have snap store installed and setup
                            You still wont need it for most of the applications
                        </p>
                        <p>But still.. </p>
                        <p>
                            You need to know the correct and complete name of the application you want to install as per the linux packages.
                            So below I have given a list of names for basic reqired packages and apps
                            You can search the internet for anything else

                            Now I think I gave you enough reasons to use Linux. But there is
                            always a catch to good things. In this case, the catch is
                            installing applications. To install applications, you have to
                            use the provided package manager, which I think contains all the
                            packages a non-programmer needs. Also, they are all free to use.
                            But for beginner programmers, some Linux distributions may be
                            quite punishing. So, I have curated the below list ranking some
                            Linux distros or you can say flavors on the basis of their
                            learning curve.

                                <li>Manjaro: Offers a more user-friendly experience compared to Arch Linux, while still
                                    providing a lot of flexibility.</li>
                                <li>Mint: Designed with a focus on ease of use and a familiar interface.</li>
                                <li>Pop!_OS: Developed by System76, designed to be user-friendly and optimized for

                                    support.</li>
                                <li>Fedora: User-friendly, but slightly more focused on advanced features and updates
                                    than
                                    Ubuntu.</li>

                                <li>Kali Linux: Primarily used for penetration testing and security assessments,
                                    requires a good understanding of Linux.</li>
                                <li>Garuda Linux: Based on Arch Linux and offers a variety of desktop environments. It
                                    inherits some complexity from Arch.</li>

                                <li>NixOS: Known for its unique package management system and configuration approach. It
                                    can be quite challenging, especially for those not familiar with Nix.</li>
                                <li>Gentoo: A highly customizable source-based distribution that requires extensive
                                    manual configuration and compilation.</li>
                                <li>Slackware: One of the oldest Linux distributions, known for its minimal hand-holding
                                    and manual configuration.</li>
                                <li>LFS (Linux From Scratch): This isn't a traditional distribution but a book that
                                    guides users in building a custom Linux system from source code. It's the ultimate
                                    challenge for learning Linux.</li>

                            Now I know the above list can be quite intimidating at first, so if you are a little bit
                            experienced in using Linux, you can choose whatever you want. But for beginners or a little
                            above beginners, I will recommend Ubuntu or Manjaro. I have used them myself and have faced
                            a little difficulties at first.

                            But once you get a hang of it, I assure you, you will only get back to Windows for gaming or
                            some software which is only supported by Windows.

                            Talking about gaming, I can assume that most of you would like gaming, so you would be
                            thinking Linux is not for me, but that is not true at all. There are many games that are not
                            supported on Linux right now. Focus on the word "right now." I am not saying this because I
                            want to force you to use Linux as nothing will come out of it for me. There are many games
                            which are supported by many Linux distros right now like Dota 2, CS:GO, and many more (I
                            would love to list them here but let's not derail from our track). Many Linux distros are
                            constantly being developed for a better gaming experience, and I am sure they will soon
                            surpass Windows in gaming too.

                            So keeping all these in mind, choose your ideal Linux distribution and dive right in. I
                            would like to tell you I am using Linux for a long time now and have hopped through many of
                            them but still have not found my ideal distribution yet. Although I love Manjaro, and am
                            currently using it.
                            So let's end this here. In the next one, I will bring to you the guide to installing Linux,
                            some mistakes that you can do while installing and how to avoid them.
