    <h1>Mojo Programming Language: Variables and Data Types</h1>

    <h2>1. Variables</h2>

    <p>In Mojo, you can assign a value to a name inside a <code>fn</code>, and it implicitly creates a function scope variable just like in Python. For example:</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let x = 10
    print(x)  # prints: 10
    </pre>

    <p>In the above example, <code>x</code> is a variable that holds the value <code>10</code>. The <code>let</code> keyword is used to declare a variable in Mojo.</p>

    <p>Mojo also has another type of variable declaration which uses the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    var x = 10
    print(x)   # prints: 10
    </pre>

    <p>On running the above code segment, we get a warning and the desired output:</p>

    <pre>
warning: 'x' was declared as a 'var' but never mutated, consider switching to a 'let'
    var x = 10
    ^
10
    </pre>

    <p>From the above, it is clear that the <code>var</code> keyword is mutable, and the warning says that it is initialized as <code>var</code> but never mutated.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if we try to mutate a variable which is initialized using <code>let</code> keyword, we get an error.</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let x = 10
    x = x + 5
    print(x)
    </pre>

    <pre>
error: expression must be mutable in assignment
    x = x + 5
    ^
    </pre>

    <p>This shows us that the <code>let</code> initialization is immutable while the <code>var</code> initialization is mutable.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Types</h2>

    <p>Mojo supports common data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Additionally, it provides advanced data types like arrays and dictionaries to handle collections of data.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Integer</h3>

    <p>An integer is a whole number that can be either greater than 0, called positive or less than 0, called negative. Zero is neither positive nor negative. For example:</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let number = 42  # integer
    print(number)    # prints: 42
    </pre>

    <p>Or</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let marks: Int = 91                 # integer
    print("Your marks are :",marks)     # prints: Your marks are 91
    </pre>

    <h3>2.2 Float</h3>

    <p>A floating point number is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. For example:</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let pi = 3.14     # float
    print(pi)         # prints: 3.14
    </pre>

    <p>Or</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let score: Float64 = 8.2              # float
    print("Your score is :", score)       # prints: Your score is 8.2
    </pre>

    <h3>2.3 String</h3>

    <p>Strings in Mojo are surrounded by either single quotation marks or double quotation marks. For example:</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let name = "Mojo"    # string
    print(name)          # prints: Mojo
    </pre>

    <p>Or</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let language: String = "Mojo"       # string
    print(language + " is awesome")     # prints: Mojo is awesome
    print(language,"is awesome")
    </pre>

    <h3>2.4 Boolean</h3>

    <p>Booleans represent one of two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. For example:</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let is_true = true    # boolean
    print(is_true)        # prints: true
    </pre>

    <p>Or</p>

    <pre>
fn main():
    let is_false: Bool = false      # boolean
    print(is_false)                 # prints: false
    </pre>
