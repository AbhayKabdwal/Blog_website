    <h2>What is Version Control</h2>

    <p><strong>Version control</strong>, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.</p>

    <p>Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>

    <p>Version control systems are essential for software development teams but can be used in various scenarios such as managing versions of digital assets, tracking changes in critical documents or even for tracking changes in configuration.</p>

    <p>Overall, version control is an essential tool for modern software development allowing teams to work together, find and fix bugs quicker, and easily revert changes among other things.</p>

    <h2>What are Git and GitHub</h2>

    <p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other’s changes. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git tracks changes made to files in a repository so you can recall specific versions later. It’s primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.</p>

    <p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based hosting service for version control repositories using Git. It’s often used for computer code. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. GitHub offers both free accounts (for open source projects) and private repositories requiring paid subscriptions.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Git</h2>

    <p>Git has many benefits such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Multiple people can work on the same project at the same time.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: You can revert back to an older version of your project at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching</strong>: You can create separate branches for developing specific features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use Git in Terminal Emulator</h2>

    <p>Using Git in the terminal can seem daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.</p>
