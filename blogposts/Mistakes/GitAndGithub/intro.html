    <h1>Version Control, Git, and GitHub: A Basic Overview</h1>
    
    <h2>Problems Solved by Version Control</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Tracking Changes:</h3>
    <p>- Without version control, it's challenging to keep track of changes made by multiple contributors.</p>
    <p>- Version control allows for a detailed history of modifications, making it easy to understand who made what changes and when.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Collaboration Challenges:</h3>
    <p>- Coordinating work among team members becomes complex without a systematic way to manage changes.</p>
    <p>- Version control facilitates collaborative development, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Backup and Recovery:</h3>
    <p>- Accidental data loss or unintended changes can occur during development.</p>
    <p>- Version control provides a safety net by allowing users to revert to previous states of a project, ensuring data integrity.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Branching and Merging:</h3>
    <p>- Developing new features or fixing bugs often requires creating isolated branches.</p>
    <p>- Version control systems, like Git, offer efficient branching and merging mechanisms, allowing developers to work on different features simultaneously and integrate changes seamlessly.</p>
    
    <h2>Git: A Distributed Version Control System</h2>
    
    <h3>What is Git?</h3>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes in source code during software development. Here are key concepts:</p>
    
    <h4>- Repositories:</h4>
    <p>- Git repositories are storage spaces for projects, containing all files and their revision history.</p>
    <p>- Repositories can be local (on a developer's machine) or remote (on a server).</p>
    
    <h4>- Commits:</h4>
    <p>- A commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.</p>
    <p>- Developers create commits to record changes made to files.</p>
    
    <h4>- Branches:</h4>
    <p>- Git allows for the creation of branches, independent lines of development.</p>
    <p>- Branches are useful for experimenting with new features without affecting the main project.</p>
    
    <h4>- Merging:</h4>
    <p>- Merging combines changes from different branches.</p>
    <p>- Developers merge branches to integrate new features or bug fixes into the main project.</p>
    
    <h4>- Pull Requests:</h4>
    <p>- In collaborative environments, developers propose changes using pull requests.</p>
    <p>- Pull requests allow for code review and discussion before changes are merged into the main branch.</p>
    
    <h2>GitHub: A Web-Based Platform for Git</h2>
    
    <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git, providing additional features and functionalities for collaborative development:</p>
    
    <h4>- Remote Repositories:</h4>
    <p>- GitHub hosts remote repositories, allowing teams to collaborate on projects.</p>
    <p>- Developers can clone repositories to work locally and push changes back to GitHub.</p>
    
    <h4>- Collaboration Tools:</h4>
    <p>- GitHub offers issue tracking, project boards, and wikis for project management.</p>
    <p>- Teams can coordinate work, report issues, and maintain documentation within the GitHub platform.</p>
    
    <h4>- Pull Requests and Code Reviews:</h4>
    <p>- GitHub facilitates pull requests, making it easy for contributors to propose changes and collaborate on improvements.</p>
    <p>- Code reviews can be conducted directly on the platform, enhancing the quality of contributions.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Use Git in Terminal Emulator</h2>

    <p>Using Git in the terminal can seem daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.</p>
