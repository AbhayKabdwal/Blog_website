        <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Algorithms provide a systematic approach to problem-solving, breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps that lead to a solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> The use of algorithms ensures that the same set of instructions, when followed, produces consistent and reproducible results, contributing to the reliability of computations.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Algorithms enable the automation of repetitive and rule-based tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and creative endeavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> In the context of software and systems, well-designed algorithms allow for scalability, ensuring that the solution remains effective as the size of the input or the complexity of the problem increases.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <ol>
