	<h1>Navigation</h1>
	<p>The first thing we need to learn (besides just typing) is how to navigate the filesystem on our Linux system.</p>
	<h2>Understanding the Filesystem Tree</h2>
	<p>Like Windows, a Unix-like operating system such as Linux organizes its files in what is called a hierarchical directory structure.</p>
	<p>This means that they are organized in a tree-like pattern of directories (sometimes called folders in other systems), which may contain files and other directories.</p>
	<p>The first directory in the filesystem is called the root directory.</p>
	<h2>The Current Working Directory</h2>
	<p>Most of us are probably familiar with a graphical file manager, which represents the filesystem tree.</p>
	<p>However, the command line has no pictures, so to navigate the filesystem tree, we need to think of it in a different way.</p>
	<p>Imagine that the filesystem is a maze shaped like an upside-down tree and we are able to stand in the middle of it.</p>
	<p>At any given time, we are inside a single directory and we can see the files contained in the directory and the pathway to the directory above us (called the parent directory) and any subdirectories below us.</p>
	<p>The directory we are standing in is called the current working directory.</p>
	<h2>Listing the Contents of a Directory</h2>
	<p>To list the files and directories in the current working directory, we use the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
	<pre>[me@linuxbox ~]$ ls
Desktop    Documents  Music     Pictures  Public    Templates  Videos</pre>
	<h2>Changing the Current Working Directory</h2>
	<p>To change your working directory (where we are standing in our tree-shaped maze) we use the <code>cd</code> command:</p>
	<pre>[me@linuxbox ~]$ cd /usr/bin
[me@linuxbox bin]$ pwd
/usr/bin</pre>
	<h2>Absolute Pathnames</h2>
	<p>An absolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed.</p>
	<h2>Relative Pathnames</h2>
	<p>Where an absolute pathname starts from the root directory and leads to its destination, a relative pathname starts from the working directory.</p>
	<p>It uses a couple of special symbols to represent relative positions in the filesystem tree.</p>
	<p>These special symbols are <code>.</code> (dot) and <code>..</code> (dot dot).</p>
	<h2>Some Helpful Shortcuts</h2>
	<p>In Table 2-1 we see some useful ways the current working directory can be quickly changed.</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Shortcut</th>
				<th>Result</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><code>cd</code></td>
				<td>Changes the working directory to your home directory.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>cd -</code></td>
				<td>Changes the working directory to the previous working directory.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>cd ~username</code></td>
				<td>Changes the working directory to the home directory of username.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
